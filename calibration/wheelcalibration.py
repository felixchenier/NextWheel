    Parameters
    ----------
    omega_static
        Angular speed measured with the IMU (gyro) during a static trial, in
        the form of an Nx3 array. Since the wheel does not move during a static
        trial, this is the gyro bias.

def estimate_acc_bias(
    acc_statics: np.ndarray,
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Estimate the accelerometer bias using three static trials.

    The function needs three different static trials to estimate the bias of
    the accelerometer of the IMU. In short, the accelerometer measures a vector
    m that contain the measurement in x, y, z. If we observe the norm. we
    have::

    m_x^2 + m_y^2 + m_z^2 = (a_x + b_x)^2 + (a_y + b_y)^2 + (a_z + b_z)^2 = N^2.

    Where m_x, m_y and m_z are measure of the accelerometer, ax, ay and az are
    the acceleration of the gravity and b_x, b_y and b_z are the bias. N is the
    norm of the m vector.

    If we develop, we obtain::

    a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2
    + 2 * (a_x * b_x + a_y * b_y + a_z * b_z)
    + b_x^2 + b_y^2 + b_z^2
    = N^2

    |g|^2
    + 2 * (a_x * b_x + a_y * b_y + a_z * bz_)
    + |b|^2 = N^2

    Using two static trials with two different orientations and subtracting
    these trials (the second trial has primes ' in the following equations),
    the constants cancel and we obtain::

    (N^2 - N'^2) / 2
     = b_x * (a_x - a_x') + b_y * (a_y - a_y') + b_z * (a_z - a_z')

    with::

    (a_x - a_x') = (m_x - m_x') because the bias cancels out;
    (a_y - a_y') = (m_y - m_y') because the bias cancels out;
    (a_z - a_z') = (m_z - m_z') because the bias cancels out.

    Therefore::

    (N^2 - N'^2) / 2
     = b_x * (m_x - m_x') + b_y * (m_y - m_y') + b_z * (m_z - m_z')

    With a minimum of three static trials, we can find the bias with a linear
    system Ax = b::

    [
        [(a_x1 - a_x2), (a_y1 - a_y2), (a_z1 - a_z2)],
        [(a_x1 - a_x3), (a_y1 - a_y3), (a_z1 - a_z3)],
        [(a_x2 - a_x3), (a_y2 - a_y3), (a_z2 - a_z3)]
    ]
    *
    [
        [b_x],
        [b_y],
        [b_z]
    ]
    =
    [
        [(N1^2 - N2^2) / 2],
        [(N1^2 - N3^2) / 2],
        [(N2^2 - N3^2) / 2]
    ]

    This function uses a least-square estimation to get the bias from any
    number of static acquisitions higher than 3.

    Parameters
    ----------
    acc_statics
        Contain at least N>=3 different static accelerometer measurements
        taken in different orientations of the wheel, in the form of an Nx3
        array.

    Calculate the rotation matrix from the IMU to the wheel's reference frames.

    The IMU measures the acceleration with the accelerometer and the gravity is
    measured as well. The static trials measure two orientations of the gravity
    (with bias). If both static trials correspond to a unique rotation around
    the y axis and both acceleration are purely in the xz-plane, then by
    subtracting one from the other, we cancel the bias and the new vector is in
    the xz-plane. From there, we can apply a cross product to find y and then
    x.

    ----------
    acc_static1
