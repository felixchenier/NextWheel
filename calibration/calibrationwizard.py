    Save two measures to find z-axis on the wheel frame.

    First, the bias is measured with a static measure of the wheel. Since the

    wheel referential). Since the gyroscope measurement is the rotation axis
    with the norm being the angular speed, the normalized gyroscope measure is
    the z-axis in the wheel frame.
