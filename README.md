# NextWheel - Open design of next-generation instrumented wheelchair wheels

The only company producing commercial instrumented wheels for standard wheelchairs (SmartWheel) closed its doors in 2014. Therefore, the existing wheels are no longer supported and are now obsolete. Since no new company sells an equivalent product, we started a project to upgrade the current SmartWheel and eventually build completely new instrumented wheels, with an open-hardware, open-source approach.

In the present state of the project, we currently have a complete replacement PCB with modern components, a firmware to flash its microcontroller, and a Python module to communicate with the wheel.

We also built instrumented wheels for racing wheelchairs, that use the same hardware and firmware as the SmartWheel replacement PCB. We aim to eventually transfer these designs to standard wheelchair wheels.

If you are interested in this project, we recommend to communicate with our team so that we can guide you or start collaborations: [chenier.felix@uqam.ca](mailto:chenier.felix@uqam.ca)

## Open science

We strongly adhere to the open science principles. Software is shared under the Apache 2 licence (in the [software](software) folder). Hardware is shared under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive (in the [hardware](hardware) section).
